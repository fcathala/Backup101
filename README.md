# backup101

*Easy versioned backup of your working directories - Fabrice Cathala - 28 December 2013*

---

**Use Case**
Create multiple versions of a folder and sub-folders (#batch #bat #cmd).
Snapshot backup of your working directory with versioning.

**History**
*Current Version*
* v1.1
Create backup as subfolders of "backup101.cmd" current folder. Working directory must be named "backup101" then previous version is named "backup102", the one before "backup103", etc...

*Roadmap*
* v1.2
Clean-up prior to the introduction of v2.0.
* v2.0
Each backup will be stored as sibling folder of working directory which is meant to store "backup101.cmd".

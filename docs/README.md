*Ultra-simple backup utility - Fabrice Cathala üê∏*

---

backup101 is an ultra-simple backup utility that generates copies of the files and folders you indicate into a folder structure going to up to 909 versions. This should be way enough to revert any project, should it be coding or documenting or anything to do with computer files, to a previous state.

The clue is on its *simplicity* to work with and could not be compared with a full-blown version control system such as [GitHub](https://github.com/). It only provides a security (backup) when working on projects single-handedly. It does NOT offer merge management, distributed repository, nor any publication or add-ons coming with all popular VCS. It does allow to go back in time and play around with good versions from the past. The actual restore operation is left to the user discretion as well as the frequency of the backups.
